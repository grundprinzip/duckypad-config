# duckypad-config

My personal DuckyPad Config. You can edit the root directory directly from the Ducky Config Tool. To sync the contents with your SDCard, simply modify `Makefile` to point to the right volume and then run

```
make
```

from the command line. This will sync the settings with the SDCard directly.
